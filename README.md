# diff-xml

Inspired by the equivalent-xml gem, I wanted a way to get the differences between the two xmls, instead of just checking to see that there were differences, this is an alternative method I came up with, and I will add as I work on it, as it is still in its infancy.

## Disclaimer

This is an alternate method to a project I was working on, as such, there are no promises that it is the most efficient way to find the differences.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'diff-xml'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install diff-xml

## Usage

coming soon.
