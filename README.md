# diff-xml

Inspired by the equivalent-xml gem, I wanted a way to get the differences between the two xmls, instead of just checking to see that there were differences, this is an alternative method I came up with, and I will add as I work on it, as it is still in its infancy.

## Disclaimer

This is an alternate method to a project I was working on, as such, there are no promises that it is the most efficient way to find the differences.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'diff-xml'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install diff-xml

## Usage

coming soon.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
